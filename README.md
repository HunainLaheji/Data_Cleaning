# Project_1_Data_Cleaning_and_Exploratory

This project involved transforming messy, raw data into a clean and structured format, followed by conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. The goal was to ensure the data's accuracy and reliability while extracting meaningful information for decision-making.

Key Features:

Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

Exploratory analysis: visualizing data distributions, identifying key trends and outliers.

Discovering hidden patterns and correlations using summary statistics and visualizations.

Why It Matters:

This project showcases the full lifecycle of data handlingâ€”from cleaning raw data to performing exploratory analysis. Clean and well-analyzed data ensures accurate insights and better decision-making, which is crucial for any data-driven process.
